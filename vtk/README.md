The `local_rendering.py` and `remote_rendering.py` expect VTK available in your virtual environment.

Just run the following `pip install vtk` or `pip install -r vtk-requirements.txt`.

In case you want to run on a headless system, you can install the OSMesa version of the vtk wheel by running `pip install -r vtk-osmesa-requirements.txt`.
